# QR_QUIDE
 With a simple QR code scan, users gain access to an interactive map that not only displays the top-down view of the campus but also allows zooming in and out for precision.What sets QR Guide apart is our ongoing commitment to innovation. We are currently working to implement real-time movement tracking within the maps. This means that users will not only see their current location but also witness their movement within the campus in real-time.
Key Features:
 QR code-based access to campus maps.
 Detailed, interactive maps with zoom functionality.
 Seamless transitions between different floors and buildings.
 Ongoing development for real-time movement tracking.
 
QR Guide is designed to simplify navigation, whether it's for new students, visitors, or anyone trying to find their way around a complex campus. Join us on this journey of making navigation effortless and enjoyable.
